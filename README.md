# Tower for Mac KDiff3 Integration
[Tower For Mac](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) is a really nice git client.
It also support a variety of 3rd party tools for diffing & merging.
To extent this list you can have a look at the [documentation](https://www.git-tower.com/help/guides/integration/custom-diff-tools/mac).

I created some files for integrating [KDiff3](https://invent.kde.org/sdk/kdiff3) into [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac).

# Setup
- Download kdiff3 from https://download.kde.org/stable/kdiff3/?C=M;O=D 
- Install to `/Applications`
- Copy folder `CompareTools` to `~/Library/Application Support/com.fournova.Tower3/`
